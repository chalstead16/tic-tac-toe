## Playing the Game

![first two rounds](https://im2.ezgif.com/tmp/ezgif-2-1be7798837.gif)

üåà starts the game by selecting an empty grid position to place their token.

Tokens may only be placed in empty grid positions. If a player attempts to place their token in a position already claimed, it will remain their turn until they select an empty grid position.

A game is won when a player has three of their tokens placed in a row diagonally, vertically, or horizontally.  

After the first round is won, the game-board will reset, the winning player's score will increase by 1, and üç∞ will start the next round.


## Game Ends in a Draw

In the event a game is ended without a player having three of their token's in a row, the gameboard will reset, neither player's score will increase
